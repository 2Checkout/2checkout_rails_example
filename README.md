### _For a discount on 2Checkoutâ€™s monthly fees, enter promo code:  GIT2CO  during signup._

###Introduction
In this repo we show an example integration of the 2Checkout payment method
into an existing Rails 3.2.2 shopping cart application using the ActiveMerchant gem.

This repository contains both an example before and after application so that you can easily 
see the integration changes. If you would like to read a tutorial that explains the integration, please visit 
[http://www.undeadzed.com/blog/integrating-2checkout-into-a-rails-application/](http://www.undeadzed.com/blog/integrating-2checkout-into-a-rails-application/).

If you have any questions or concerns, let me know. 
I will be happy to help with your application and get you up and running.
