###Introduction
In this repo we show an example integration of the 2Checkout payment method
into an existing Rails 3.2.2 shopping cart application using the ActiveMerchant gem.

###Setting up the Example Application
We need an existing example application to demonstrate the integration so lets
clone the 2checkout-rails-example application.

`
$ git clone https://github.com/craigchristenson/2checkout_rails_example
`

This repository contains both an example before and after application. If you would like 
to read a tutorial that explains the integration, please visit 
[http://www.undeadzed.com/blog/integrating-2checkout-into-a-rails-application/](http://www.undeadzed.com/blog/integrating-2checkout-into-a-rails-application/) 
and follow the tutorial.

If you have any questions or concerns, let me know. 
I will be happy to help with your application and get you up and running.
